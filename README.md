# earth2moon
This is a restricted three-body problem simulation that uses the Runge-Kutta (4th order) method. The goal is to simulate the trajectory a rocket would follow if it was launched from the Earth to the Moon. Both fixed step length and adaptive step length are used in order to compare the differences between the two methods.
